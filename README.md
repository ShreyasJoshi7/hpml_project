# hpml_project
This is the project for the HPML course. It is a NEAT Algorithm agent for Flappy Bird game.

The project contains graphics but the focus of the project is the understanding and implementation of the NEAT Algorithm. The aim of the projectis to deep dive into the NEAT Algorithm and know how the algorithm works on a deeper level. 

To run the training, run the run.py file. --> python3 run.py
Or upload into the hpc and install install all the requirements mentioned in the requirements.txt and use the sbatch file to run the project.

File Structure:
1.imgs Folder contains the images used to build the graphics.
2. run.py --> to run the project
3. graphics_and_plot.py --> used by run.py
4. config-feedforward.txt --> hyperparameters of the NEAT Algorithm.
